The marketing team of a bank wants to launch a targeted ad marketing campaign by dividing their customers into at least 3 distinctive groups.  Unsupervised learning techniques to divide customers in segments based on their credit card consumption habits. 

The following methods/techniques are used in this project:

- K-Means clustering to classify customers in four (4) and eight (8) segments.
- PCA and autoencoding for dimensionality redution.
- Hierarchical clustering  techniques (agglomerative clustering,birch), density clustering techniques (DBScan) and gaussian mixture. 

To judge the quality of the clusters, I have used the silhouette score and silhouette diagrams.
