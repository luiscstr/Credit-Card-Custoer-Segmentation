**PROJECT SUMMARY**
Unsupervised learning techniques are to divide customers in segments based on their credit card consumption habits. 

The following methods/techniques are used in this project:

- K-Means clustering to classify customers in four (4) and eight (8) segments.
- PCA and autoencoding for dimensionality redution.
- Hierarchical clustering  techniques (agglomerative clustering,birch), density clustering techniques (DBScan) and gaussian mixture. 

To judge the quality of the clusters, silhouette score and silhouette diagrams are used.
